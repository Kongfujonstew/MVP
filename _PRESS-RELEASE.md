Youkereoke


Welcome to Youkereoke!  

The best Karaoke platform in history, fun for home use or at entertainment establishments.

Youkereoke puts the power of selection right into your hands.  Instead of spending your time at the console waiting for someone else to pick their song, you can search at your own leisure from your own device.

Traditional kareoke forces everyone in the room to wait while one person selects their video.  Also, it is less interactive than it could be.  People have to shout feedback at the singer over the songs.

Youkereoke is a multi-client real-time kareoke interface that allows several users to search at the same time, from their own devices.  Users don't even have to be in the room to sign up to sign a song.  

Youkereoke furthermore gives updates on the queue.  That means that if you're in line for a song, you just check your phone for info on how many people are in line ahead of you.

Finally, Youkereoke incorporates a realtime messaging that lets audience members blast their thoughts right to the screen.

Company founder and coder, Jon Stewart said: "I am so excited to launch this to the public.  I'm not sure which is larger - the home entertainment market or the commercial entertainment space.  They're both huge.  Probably worth billions."

Youkereoke is available 24 hours a day at yko.herokuapp.com.

One of the users at a San Francisco club texted: "I love it whooooooo!  Freebird!"
